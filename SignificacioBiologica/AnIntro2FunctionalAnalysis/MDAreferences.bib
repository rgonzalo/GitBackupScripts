  abstract = {Identification of new prognostic factors for colon cancer with no
	lymph node involvement may improve the selection of patients for
	adjuvant chemotherapy. The aim of this study was to assess the possibility
	of using gene expression profiling for this purpose. Fifty patients
	operated on for stage II colon cancer were included. Twenty-five
	of these patients relapsed, while the other 25 remained disease-free
	for at least 5 years. MRNA was extracted from fresh-frozen biopsies
	and hybridized to the Affymetrix GeneChip HGU133A. One thousand six
	hundred random splits of the 50 patients into a training set and
	a validation set were considered. For each split, a prognostic combination
	was derived from the training set (selection of the 30 genes most
	differentially expressed between patients who recurred and those
	who did not, by linear discriminant analysis), and its prognostic
	performance was assessed with the validation set. On average, accuracy
	was 76%, sensitivity 85%, and specificity 68%. A total of 6,124 genes
	were included in at least one of the 1,600 predictive combinations,
	and 55 genes were included in more than 100 combinations. This study
	supports the possibility of predicting the prognosis of non-metastatic
	colon cancer by tumor gene expression profiling. It also shows the
	highly variable gene composition of predictive combinations.},

	the S language and to its programming environment, the premier software
	platform for computing with data. Programming with Data describes
	a new and greatly extended version of S, and is written by the chief
	designer of the language. The book is a guide to the complete programming
	process, starting from simple, interactive use and continuing through
	ambitious software {projects.S} is designed for computing with data
	- for any project in which organizing, visualizing, summarizing,
	or modeling data is a central concern. Its focus is on the needs
	of the programmer/user, and its goal is "to turn ideas into software,
	quickly and faithfully." S is a functional, object-based language
	with a huge library of functions for all aspects of computing with
	data. Its long and enthusiastic use in statistics and applied fields
	has also led to many valuable libraries of user-written {functions.The}
	new version of S provides a powerful class/method structure, new
	techniques to deal with large objects, extended interfaces to other
	languages and files, object-based documentation compatible with {HTML},
	and powerful new interactive programming techniques. This version
	of S underlies the {S-Plus} system, versions 5.0 and {higher.John}
	Chambers has been a member of the technical staff in research at
	Bell Laboratories since 1966. In 1977, he became the first statistician
	to be named a Bell Labs Fellow, cited for "pioneering contributions
	to the field of statistical computing." His research has touched
	on nearly all aspects of computing with data, but he is best known
	for the design of the S language. He is the author or co-author of
	seven books on S, on computational methods, and on graphical methods;
	and he is a Fellow of the American Statistical Association and the
	American Association for the Advancement of Science.},

	data, assessing their performance using control datasets becomes
	increasingly important.RESULTS:We present a 'spike-in' experiment
	for Affymetrix GeneChips that provides a defined dataset of 3,860
	RNA species, which we use to evaluate analysis options for identifying
	differentially expressed genes. The experimental design incorporates
	two novel features. First, to obtain accurate estimates of false-positive
	and false-negative rates, 100-200 RNAs are spiked in at each fold-change
	level of interest, ranging from 1.2 to 4-fold. Second, instead of
	using an uncharacterized background RNA sample, a set of 2,551 RNA
	species is used as the constant (1x) set, allowing us to know whether
	any given probe set is truly present or absent. Application of a
	large number of analysis methods to this dataset reveals clear variation
	in their ability to identify differentially expressed genes. False-negative
	and false-positive rates are minimized when the following options
	are chosen: subtracting nonspecific signal from the PM probe intensities;
	performing an intensity-dependent normalization at the probe set
	level; and incorporating a signal intensity-dependent standard deviation
	in the test statistic.CONCLUSIONS:A best-route combination of analysis
	methods is presented that allows detection of approximately 70% of
	true positives before reaching a 10% false-discovery rate. We highlight
	areas in need of improvement, including better estimate of false-discovery
	rates and decreased false-negative rates.},

  abstract = {Previous microarray studies on breast cancer identified multiple tumour
	classes, of which the most prominent, named luminal and basal, differ
	in expression of the oestrogen receptor alpha gene {(ER).} We report
	here the identification of a group of breast tumours with increased
	androgen signalling and a 'molecular apocrine' gene expression profile.
	Tumour samples from 49 patients with large operable or locally advanced
	breast cancers were tested on Affymetrix {U133A} gene expression
	microarrays. Principal components analysis and hierarchical clustering
	split the tumours into three groups: basal, luminal and a group we
	call molecular apocrine. All of the molecular apocrine tumours have
	strong apocrine features on histological examination {(P=0.0002).}
	The molecular apocrine group is androgen receptor {(AR)} positive
	and contains all of the {ER-negative} tumours outside the basal group.
	{Kolmogorov-Smirnov} testing indicates that oestrogen signalling
	is most active in the luminal group, and androgen signalling is most
	active in the molecular apocrine group. {ERBB2} amplification is
	commoner in the molecular apocrine than the other groups. Genes that
	best split the three groups were identified by Wilcoxon test. Correlation
	of the average expression profile of these genes in our data with
	the expression profile of individual tumours in four published breast
	cancer studies suggest that molecular apocrine tumours represent
	8-14\% of tumours in these studies. Our data show that it is possible
	with microarray data to divide mammary tumour cells into three groups
	based on steroid receptor activity: luminal {(ER+} {AR+)}, basal
	{(ER-} {AR-)} and molecular apocrine {(ER-} {AR+).}},

We identify a number of annotation challenges that must be addressed to enable development of the next generation of pathway analysis methods.

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Microarray data must be background corrected to remove
	the effects of non-specific binding or spatial heterogeneity across
	the array, but this practice typically causes other problems such
	as negative corrected intensities and high variability of low intensity
	log-ratios. Different estimators of background, and various model-based
	processing methods, are compared in this study in search of the best
	option for differential expression analyses of small microarray experiments.
	RESULTS: Using data where some independent truth in gene expression
	is known, eight different background correction alternatives are
	compared, in terms of precision and bias of the resulting gene expression
	measures, and in terms of their ability to detect differentially
	expressed genes as judged by two popular algorithms, SAM and limma
	eBayes. A new background processing method (normexp) is introduced
	which is based on a convolution model. The model-based correction
	methods are shown to be markedly superior to the usual practice of
	subtracting local background estimates. Methods which stabilize the
	variances of the log-ratios along the intensity range perform the
	best. The normexp+offset method is found to give the lowest false
	discovery rate overall, followed by morph and vsn. Like vsn, normexp
	is applicable to most types of two-colour microarray data. AVAILABILITY:

  abstract = {The problem of identifying differentially expressed genes in designed
	microarray experiments is considered. Lonnstedt and Speed (2002)
	derived an expression for the posterior odds of differential expression
	in a replicated two-color experiment using a simple hierarchical
	parametric model. The purpose of this paper is to develop the hierarchical
	model of Lonnstedt and Speed (2002) into a practical approach for
	general microarray experiments with arbitrary numbers of treatments
	and RNA samples. The model is reset in the context of general linear
	models with arbitrary coefficients and contrasts of interest. The
	approach applies equally well to both single channel and two color
	microarray experiments. Consistent, closed form estimators are derived
	for the hyperparameters in the model. The estimators proposed have
	robust behavior even for small numbers of arrays and allow for incomplete
	data arising from spot filtering or spot quality weights. The posterior
	odds statistic is reformulated in terms of a moderated t-statistic
	in which posterior residual standard deviations are used in place
	of ordinary standard deviations. The empirical Bayes approach is
	equivalent to shrinkage of the estimated sample variances towards
	a pooled estimate, resulting in far more stable inference when the
	number of arrays is small. The use of moderated t-statistics has
	the advantage over the posterior odds that the number of hyperparameters
	which need to estimated is reduced; in particular, knowledge of the
	non-null prior for the fold changes are not required. The moderated
	t-statistic is shown to follow a t-distribution with augmented degrees
	of freedom. The moderated t inferential approach extends to accommodate
	tests of composite null hypotheses through the use of moderated F-statistics.
	The performance of the methods is demonstrated in a simulation study.
	Results are presented for two publicly available data sets.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Spotted arrays are often printed with probes in duplicate
	or triplicate, but current methods for assessing differential expression
	are not able to make full use of the resulting information. The usual
	practice is to average the duplicate or triplicate results for each
	probe before assessing differential expression. This results in the
	loss of valuable information about genewise variability. RESULTS:
	A method is proposed for extracting more information from within-array
	replicate spots in microarray experiments by estimating the strength
	of the correlation between them. The method involves fitting separate
	linear models to the expression data for each gene but with a common
	value for the between-replicate correlation. The method greatly improves
	the precision with which the genewise variances are estimated and
	thereby improves inference methods designed to identify differentially
	expressed genes. The method may be combined with empirical Bayes
	methods for moderating the genewise variances between genes. The
	method is validated using data from a microarray experiment involving
	calibration and ratio control spots in conjunction with spiked-in
	RNA. Comparing results for calibration and ratio control spots shows
	that the common correlation method results in substantially better
	discrimination of differentially expressed genes from those which
	are not. The spike-in experiment also confirms that the results may
	be further improved by empirical Bayes smoothing of the variances
	when the sample size is small. AVAILABILITY: The methodology is implemented

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:Concomitant with the rise in the popularity of DNA microarrays
	has been a surge of proposed methods for the analysis of microarray
	data. Fully controlled "spike-in" datasets are an invaluable but
	rare tool for assessing the performance of various methods.RESULTS:We
	generated a new wholly defined Affymetrix spike-in dataset consisting
	of 18 microarrays. Over 5700 RNAs are spiked in at relative concentrations
	ranging from 1- to 4-fold, and the arrays from each condition are
	balanced with respect to both total RNA amount and degree of positive
	versus negative fold change. We use this new "Platinum Spike" dataset
	to evaluate microarray analysis routes and contrast the results to
	those achieved using our earlier Golden Spike dataset.CONCLUSIONS:We
	present updated best-route methods for Affymetrix GeneChip analysis
	and demonstrate that the degree of "imbalance" in gene expression
	has a significant effect on the performance of these methods.},

	abstract = {Functional analysis of large gene lists, derived in most cases from emerging high-throughput genomic, proteomic and bioinformatics scanning approaches, is still a challenging and daunting task. The gene-annotation enrichment analysis is a promising high-throughput strategy that increases the likelihood for investigators to identify biological processes most pertinent to their study. Approximately 68 bioinformatics enrichment tools that are currently available in the community are collected in this survey. Tools are uniquely categorized into three major classes, according to their underlying enrichment algorithms. The comprehensive collections, unique tool classifications and associated questions/issues will provide a more comprehensive and up-to-date view regarding the advantages, pitfalls and recent trends in a simpler tool-class level rather than by a tool-by-tool approach. Thus, the survey will help tool designers/developers and experienced end users understand the underlying algorithms and pertinent details of particular tool categories/tools, enabling them to make the best choices for their particular research interests.},

	title = {{GAGE}: generally applicable gene set enrichment for pathway analysis},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2105-10-161},
	shorttitle = {{GAGE}},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Gene set analysis ({GSA}) is a widely used strategy for gene expression data analysis based on pathway knowledge. {GSA} focuses on sets of related genes and has established major advantages over individual gene analyses, including greater robustness, sensitivity and biological relevance. However, previous {GSA} methods have limited usage as they cannot handle datasets of different sample sizes or experimental designs.
{RESULTS}: To address these limitations, we present a new {GSA} method called Generally Applicable Gene-set Enrichment ({GAGE}). We successfully apply {GAGE} to multiple microarray datasets with different sample sizes, experimental designs and profiling techniques. {GAGE} shows significantly better results when compared to two other commonly used {GSA} methods of {GSEA} and {PAGE}. We demonstrate this improvement in the following three aspects: (1) consistency across repeated studies/experiments; (2) sensitivity and specificity; (3) biological relevance of the regulatory mechanisms inferred.{GAGE} reveals novel and relevant regulatory mechanisms from both published and previously unpublished microarray studies. From two published lung cancer data sets, {GAGE} derived a more cohesive and predictive mechanistic scheme underlying lung cancer progress and metastasis. For a previously unpublished {BMP}6 study, {GAGE} predicted novel regulatory mechanisms for {BMP}6 induced osteoblast differentiation, including the canonical {BMP}-{TGF} beta signaling, {JAK}-{STAT} signaling, Wnt signaling, and estrogen signaling pathways-all of which are supported by the experimental literature.
{CONCLUSION}: {GAGE} is generally applicable to gene expression datasets with different sample sizes and experimental designs. {GAGE} consistently outperformed two most frequently used {GSA} methods and inferred statistically and biologically more relevant regulatory pathways. The {GAGE} method is implemented in R in the "gage" package, available under the {GNU} {GPL} from http://sysbio.engin.umich.edu/{\textasciitilde}luow/downloads.php.},
